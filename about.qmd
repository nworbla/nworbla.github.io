## Background

I am currently a senior studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science at Brigham Young University. I am interested in applying data analysis and statistical methods to social science, particularly human development and family studies, and expect to graduate in December 2026.

## Education

- **Bachelor’s Degree in Statistics (Emphasis in Data Science)**  
  Minor in Family Life  
  Brigham Young University — Expected December 2026
  
- **Relevant Coursework**:
  Statistics, Probability and Inference, Statistical Modeling, Analysis of Variance (statistical foundations);  
  Applied R Programming, Data Science Process, Data Science Ecosystems (data science and computing);  
  Linear Algebra, Computer Programming, Data Structures (mathematical and computational foundations).

## Experience

- **Applied Statistics and Data Analysis Projects**  
  Gained hands-on experience through coursework involving data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming in R and Python. Projects included data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interpretation of results in applied contexts.

- **Independent Social Science Research Project**  
  Designed and completed a full research project in a Critical Inquiry and Research Methods course, including research question development, literature review, data collection, analysis, and a written research report. 

- **Science and History Tutor**  
  Provide individualized science and history tutoring for an autistic, home-schooled student. Responsibilities include adapting instruction to the student’s learning needs and fostering engagement through personalized lessons.

- **Volunteer Work**  
  Served as a full-time representative of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Argentina for 18 months. Experience included leadership responsibilities, cross-cultural communication, and achieving fluency in Spanish.

## Skills & Interests

### Technical Skills
- **Programming**: Python, R; introductory experience with C++, Linux, and SQL
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, exploratory analysis
- **Visualization**: introductory experience with Tableau
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub

### Areas of Interest
- Social science and human development research
- Family and relationship data
- Applying data science to real-world human-centered problems

## Goals

Although I have limited experience, I am focused on continuing to develop strong foundations in statistical modeling and data science. I aim to gain experience applying data analysis to social science and family-related research questions, and I am exploring opportunities that combine data science with human- and family-centered research.

## Get to Know Me

Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time with my family and caring for my baby boy. I also love cooking, sweet treats, and finding simple yet delicious recipes. You might catch me playing the piano or cello when I have the time.
