    "section": "Basic Syntax",
    "text": "Basic Syntax\nTo categorize your data by a certain variable, first, call the groupby() function on your data frame with the variable column name as your argument. When you call groupby(), pandas creates groups based on the unique values of that column. Those grouped values become the index of the summarized result after a function is applied.\n\ndf.groupby(\"Store\")\n\nNext, add a call to a function. The format of the code below will apply the function to all other variables grouped by the groupby variable. Adding only a function, as below, may raise an error if some of the other columns contain string values. Note that max() and min() will provide the first and last alphabetically respectively for string values. Adding the argument numeric_only = True to the function will apply the function only to numeric variables.\n\ndf.groupby(\"Store\").mean()\n\nTo get the result of a single variable, place it in brackets after the groupby variable(s) and apply the function at the end.\nTo select a single column after grouping, you can use either single or double brackets. The single bracket will return a Series, while the double brackets will return a DataFrame.\nThe code below will give us the average price of cereal per store. We can see that the average price of cereal at Walmart is higher than at Target.\n\ndf.groupby(\"Store\")[\"Price\"].mean()\n\nStore\nTarget     3.465\nWalmart    4.590\nName: Price, dtype: float64\n\n\n\ndf.groupby(\"Store\")[[\"Price\"]].mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n\n\nStore\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n3.465\n\n\nWalmart\n4.590\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that multiple columns can be selected at once. The following code will give us the average price and sugar content of cereal per store.\n\ndf.groupby(\"Store\")[[\"Price\", \"Sugar_grams\"]].mean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nSugar_grams\n\n\nStore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n3.465\n7.25\n\n\nWalmart\n4.590\n7.50"

Yet, even the simplest uses of groupby() can effectively answer the most common data analysis questions.\nTo dive deeper into the groupby() function, check out the official pandas documentation here. For more about the split-apply-combine process, which is the underlying mechanism of groupby(), see this documentation here. I encourage you to epxlore the documentation as you will find many more ways to use groupby() and many more functions to apply to your grouped data.\nNow it’s your turn to apply groupby() to some data. You can use the simple cereal dataset we used in this tutorial, or you can find your own dataset to practice with. Try grouping by different variables and applying different functions to see what insights you can uncover! Have fun grouping!"
