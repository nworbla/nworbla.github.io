    "text": "Introduction\nSuppose we want to calculate the total sales of an item per store. Or the average price per product category rather than the average price overall. In data analysis, we often want to goup by category to summarize our data.\nThe pandas groupby() function allows us to do just that.\nThe groupby() function is designed to split data by category or groups based on one or more coloumns and compute summary statitics based on those groups. When called by itself, the output does not look meaningful, which may seem confusing at first. However, adding a simple function and even resetting the index can prove groupby() to be a powerful pandas tool.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll walk through the simple ways we can use groupby() effectively.\n#| echo: false\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    \"Cereal\": [\"Frosted Flakes\", \"Cheerios\", \"Lucky Charms\", \"Raisin Bran\",\n               \"Corn Flakes\", \"Honey Nut Oats\", \"Granola Crunch\", \"Cocoa Puffs\"],\n\n    \"Store\": [\"Walmart\", \"Walmart\", \"Walmart\", \"Walmart\",\n              \"Target\", \"Target\", \"Target\", \"Target\"],\n\n    \"Brand_type\": [\"name brand\", \"name brand\", \"name brand\", \"name brand\",\n                   \"name brand\", \"generic\", \"generic\", \"name brand\"],\n\n    \"Price\": [4.29, 3.99, 4.59, 5.49, 3.49, 2.79, 3.19, 4.39],\n\n    \"Sugar_grams\": [12, 1, 10, 7, 2, 8, 6, 13]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf"
